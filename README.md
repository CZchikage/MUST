The codes for computing delta bounds given epsilon for the subsampled Gaussian mechanism over compositions are based on the 
repository https://github.com/DPBayes/PLD-Accountant, which contains the implementations for the Poisson subsampling and sampling without replacement cases.
We add the codes for computing the privacy profile for the case of using sampling with replacement in the subsampled Gaussian mechanism
and provide the privacy profile computation codes for the subsampled Gaussian mechanism with H subsampling.

The R codes for the privacy amplification effect comparison and Python codes for privacy composition analysis in the simulation study.
